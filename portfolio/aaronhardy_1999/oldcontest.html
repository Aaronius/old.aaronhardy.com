        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As of 
          right now (December 5, 1999), my car's odometer is sitting at 199,257 
          miles. The question is: at what point in time will it roll over to 200,000 
          miles? My car is a 1985 Honda Accord. Although it may seem old, I love 
          it dearly - at least the motor anyway. Everything else isn't so top-notch. 
          To explain:<br>
          1) I should just make plans to cut the top off and make it a convertable. 
          Afterall, it wouldn't make much difference in air flow or temperature 
          inside the car. <br>
          2) Anyone want a full-body massage? Go ahead and sit on my dashboard.<br>
          3) Anyone for some target practice? I don't mind if you shoot the side 
          of my car, afterall it already looks like somebody's taken a shot-gun 
          to it. (This is do to door-dings. There are no dents due to poor driving, 
          keep in mind.)<br>
          Now, since you've got most of the details of my car I'll explain the 
          rules, etc: put in your name, email address, address, and the time you 
          think it will roll over to 200,000 miles and send it off. You can only 
          vote once per day and the closest guesser (guessee, guessist?) will 
          get a prize not yet decided on, but I assure you it will be well worth 
          the effort. Remember, you can vote once per day so keep trying as often 
          as possible for a better chance of winning. The information you provide 
          will in no way be sold or distributed and you won't be annoyed by any 
          ads or anything else. It only be used to notify you when I hit 200K. 
          On to the contest...</font></p>
