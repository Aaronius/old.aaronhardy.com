          it could just fall in that category on accident. It will receive no 
          grammatical screening. No extreme spiffying up. It's clearly to show 
          my points, theories, info, whatever. You're not pressured to read it...but 
          you might grow to be friends with it.....sort of like dust on a telephone

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Aaronius, 
          I sure do like your site! I really like giving control to the viewer 
          to select if the can either enter the site or not if they have Flash. 
          Reason is, a lot of sites tell me no Flash is detected, when I DO have 
          it! That irritates me to no end. Maybe you could also list the version 
          of Flash you want them to use. Or say if both versions will work. Do 
          you have any sounds? I didn't get any. It would be nice ot hear some 
          sound if only a few. Great Job!</font> </p>

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">WOW!! 
          What a beautifully designed site! Gorgeous graphics, wonderful color, 
          nice layout, and technically superb code. And on top of that, such nicely 
          written, homey content. I like it!</font><br>

          Note: </b>When sending me feedback, it'd be great if you would let me 
          know how you found my site. (From a friend, search engine, my signature, 
          etc.) Thanks.</font></p>
