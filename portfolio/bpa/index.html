POLAR LANDER The lander and microprobes were in excellent health during launch  and the nine-month transit to Mars. On December 3rd, 1999,  about ten minutes before it was expected to land on the south  polar region of Mars (the first time a mission had been sent to that  region), the lander lost contact with Earth and it was never  regained. JPL scientists are currently determining what happened to  the lander; it's assumed that it crashed on the Martian surface. The  microprobes also never were located and its assumed that they  were destroyed on impact .  The Polar Lander was to carry out a 90  day primary mission followed by an extended mission lasting until  a terminal hardware failure. The Deep Space 2 Microprobes were  a technology demonstrator mission which would also have  returned science about Mars. As the Polar Lander separated from  its cruise stage in preparation of entering the Martian atmosphere  and landing, the two probes presumably detached and impacted  the ground. Unfortuantely they did not succeed in landing safely  and sending back signals to the Mars Global Surveyor orbiting  overhead.  MARS GLOBAL SURVEYOR The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) mission is the first successful  orbiter mission to Mars since the Viking program in 1976. MGS  was launched in 1996 and arrived at Mars on November of 1997,  a few months after Mars Pathfinder. Its mission is to  comprehensively map the entire Martian surface and also carries a  laser altimeter which can measure the topography of Mars. NOZOMI/PLANET-B Launched July 4, 1998, the Japanese mission, known as Planet-B  throughout the planning and buliding phases, was renamed  "Nozomi" immediately after launch.  The $80 million dollar probe  is designed to study the atmosphere and ionosphere of Mars, and  carries fourteen instruments from five nations, including a NASA  Neutral Mass Spectrometer. Unfortuately, the spacecraft used up  too much fuel during a trajectory correction maneuver and will  have to fly a circuitous route to get to Mars. As a result, it will not  arrive until 2003, four years later than planned.  POLAR LANDER The lander and microprobes were in excellent health during launch  and the nine-month transit to Mars.

Public attention started to build on Mars about three years ago  when Mars Pathfinder and Mars Global Surveyor sent back pictures  of towering volcanoes and gaping chasms on the windswept  planet. Every 26 months over the next decade, when the alignment  of Earth and Mars are suitable for launches, still more robotic  spacecraft will join them at the red planet. All these instruments are  set out to help us obtain the goal of understanding Mars better.  In the late 1800's, astronomer Percival Lowell founded an  observatory in Arizona centered mostly on studying Mars. He  noticed little canals. He was convinced that they were dug by  intelligent beings. So far, the explorations and chemical testings  show a desolate land, but scientists still continued to study the  geology and climate of Mars. In 1996, scientists at Stanford University announced that a  metoeorite believed to have originated on Mars contained what  might be the fossils of ancient microbes. This meteorite is thought  to have come from Mars because the gasses trapped in some of  the rocks match the composition of Mars' atmosphere. Not all  scientists agree with this announcement, but it reopened the issue  of living on Mars. The fundamental requirements for life as we know it are liquid  water, organic compounds, and an energy source for synthesizing  complex organic molecules. Lately, biologists found that microbial  life has an amazing flexibility for surviving in extreme environments  such as extraordinarily hot, cold, dry, or high pressure niches. Such  conditions would be inhospitable to humans or complex animals.  This led scientists to conclude that life would not be found at the  foot of a lander spacecraft, but it may have (and still might) thrived  billions of years ago in an undergound thermal spring, where there  is liquid water.  Scientists who have studied images from the planet notice features  that appeared to be formed by flowing water- among them deep  channels and canyons, and even ancient lake shorelines. Scientists  believe that the planet was either warm at one time or  underground ice was periodically released when heating caused  ice to melt and gush forth onto the surface. Neither theory is  thought to be true, because the thin Martian atmosphere would  cause the water to evaporate quickly. Scientists believe that the  atmosphere may have thinned out over many eons by entrapment  of carbon dioxide in rocks across its surface. There is no better way to finding the truth behind all this than by  sending more missions to Mars. Do you think that we here on Earth  will benefit from this discovery? That is a big question on  everyone's mind. Apparently, there are a lot of scientists who think  that this is important.

Scientists  believe that the planet was either warm at one time or  underground ice was periodically released when heating caused  ice to melt and gush forth onto the surface. Neither theory is  thought to be true, because the thin Martian atmosphere would  cause the water to evaporate quickly. Scientists believe that the  atmosphere may have thinned out over many eons by entrapment  of carbon dioxide in rocks across its surface. There is no better way to finding the truth behind all this than by  sending more missions to Mars. Do you think that we here on Earth  will benefit from this discovery? That is a big question on  everyone's mind. Apparently, there are a lot of scientists who think  that this is important. Public attention started to build on Mars about three years ago  when Mars Pathfinder and Mars Global Surveyor sent back pictures  of towering volcanoes and gaping chasms on the windswept  planet. Every 26 months over the next decade, when the alignment  of Earth and Mars are suitable for launches, still more robotic  spacecraft will join them at the red planet. All these instruments are  set out to help us obtain the goal of understanding Mars better.  In the late 1800's, astronomer Percival Lowell founded an  observatory in Arizona centered mostly on studying Mars. He  noticed little canals. He was convinced that they were dug by  intelligent beings. So far, the explorations and chemical testings  show a desolate land, but scientists still continued to study the  geology and climate of Mars. In 1996, scientists at Stanford University announced that a  metoeorite believed to have originated on Mars contained what  might be the fossils of ancient microbes. This meteorite is thought  to have come from Mars because the gasses trapped in some of  the rocks match the composition of Mars' atmosphere. Not all  scientists agree with this announcement, but it reopened the issue  of living on Mars. The fundamental requirements for life as we know it are liquid  water, organic compounds, and an energy source for synthesizing  complex organic molecules. Lately, biologists found that microbial  life has an amazing flexibility for surviving in extreme environments  such as extraordinarily hot, cold, dry, or high pressure niches. Such  conditions would be inhospitable to humans or complex animals.

That is a big question on  everyone's mind. Apparently, there are a lot of scientists who think  that this is important. The exploration of Mars will continue into our future.  Plans  have all ready been made for several Mars missions in the  near future. The 2001 opportunity to launch for Mars will see  the next two Mars Surveyor Program missions.  These are  known as the Mars Surveyor 2001 Orbiter and Lander.  On  the lander there will be a rover, the first since Mars Pathfinder's  Sojourner rover in 1997.  This 2001 mission will give scientists  some new looks on Mars and some new information for more  future missions.   The 2001 Lander will carry a descent  camera, which will use during its rocket-assisted landing.  Pictures sent back will provide information for landing future  probes, and help in the planning of future rover missions.  The  lander will also carry several interesting experiments for future  human missions.  One experiment will test the capability of  converting Martian atmosphere into rocket fuel, which will be  of vital importance for manned missions.  There will be  experiments testing if the Martian environment will be harmful  to human explorers.   A Gamma Ray Spectometer will map the  global elemental composition of Mars and search for  hydrogen and water below the surface of the red planet.  The  2001 missions are planned to launch on April 10, 2001 and  to land on Mars on January 22, 2002. NASA had planned on sending a Mars Airplane Flight in  2003.  It would have taken off on Dec. 17, 2003, the 100th  anniversary of the day the Wright brothers' first powered flight  at Kitty Hawk, N.C.  NASA had to scratch this date and the  plans are now for an Airplane mission in the year 2005.  The  Mars Airplane had an estimated cost of $100 million. The  plane would mark the first time a winged vehicle has flown on  another planetary body other than the Earth.  A proposed  mission agenda for the plane would have it fly through the  Vallis Marineris, a martian canyon 2,400 miles long and more  than five miles deep. This flight would give scientists an up- close look at the canyon's walls, which could give information  on millions of years of Mar's geological history.  Flying on  Mars won't be any easy task.  It's atmosphere is only one  percent as dense as Earth's.  The wings of the Mars Airplane  will be put the an extreme test to generate lift. The European Space Agency has planned the Mars Express  mission.  Mars Express, leaving n 2003, will study the  atmosphere and surface for a full Martian year of 687 days  with seven instruments.   Topographic maps will be made,  rock and soil analysis will be taken in infra-red, and  measurements of Mars interior composition will be made with  radar.  The atmosphere will also be studied along with the  solar wind. From these studies we will measure the  atmospheric composition and structure.  In addition, the  United Kingdom is planning to fly a lander with the Mars  Express orbiter.  This will be known as the Beagle 2(the first  Beagle being Darwin's ship on which he discovered the theory  of evolution).  This lander will conduct a search for life on  Mars.  It's landing mechanism will combine a  parachute/airbag to protect it on it's descent.  The Beagle 2  will carry a robotic arm, stereo color imager, a small drilling  unit, and a video camera.  The mission will try to answer if  Mars has water, organic matter, or carbonates.  The discovery  of these things could provide important clues on current, past,  or future life on Mars. The long-term future of missions to Mars is currently unclear.   Everything will depend on gaining small successes in the  currently planned missions.  Small steps could lead up to big  future planes for NASA.  Everything could lead up to future  colonization plans and everyday flights to and from the 4th  rock from the sun. The exploration of Mars will continue into our future.  Plans  have all ready been made for several Mars missions in the  near future.

The long-term future of missions to Mars is currently unclear.   Everything will depend on gaining small successes in the  currently planned missions.  Small steps could lead up to big  future planes for NASA.  Everything could lead up to future  colonization plans and everyday flights to and from the 4th  rock from the sun. The exploration of Mars will continue into our future.  Plans  have all ready been made for several Mars missions in the  near future. The 2001 opportunity to launch for Mars will see  the next two Mars Surveyor Program missions.  These are  known as the Mars Surveyor 2001 Orbiter and Lander.  On  the lander there will be a rover, the first since Mars Pathfinder's  Sojourner rover in 1997.  This 2001 mission will give scientists  some new looks on Mars and some new information for more  future missions.   The 2001 Lander will carry a descent  camera, which will use during its rocket-assisted landing.  Pictures sent back will provide information for landing future  probes, and help in the planning of future rover missions.  The  lander will also carry several interesting experiments for future  human missions.  One experiment will test the capability of  converting Martian atmosphere into rocket fuel, which will be  of vital importance for manned missions.  There will be  experiments testing if the Martian environment will be harmful  to human explorers.   A Gamma Ray Spectometer will map the  global elemental composition of Mars and search for  hydrogen and water below the surface of the red planet.  The  2001 missions are planned to launch on April 10, 2001 and  to land on Mars on January 22, 2002. NASA had planned on sending a Mars Airplane Flight in  2003.  It would have taken off on Dec. 17, 2003, the 100th  anniversary of the day the Wright brothers' first powered flight  at Kitty Hawk, N.C.  NASA had to scratch this date and the  plans are now for an Airplane mission in the year 2005.  The  Mars Airplane had an estimated cost of $100 million. The  plane would mark the first time a winged vehicle has flown on  another planetary body other than the Earth.  A proposed  mission agenda for the plane would have it fly through the  Vallis Marineris, a martian canyon 2,400 miles long and more  than five miles deep. This flight would give scientists an up- close look at the canyon's walls, which could give information  on millions of years of Mar's geological history.  Flying on  Mars won't be any easy task.  It's atmosphere is only one  percent as dense as Earth's.  The wings of the Mars Airplane  will be put the an extreme test to generate lift. The European Space Agency has planned the Mars Express  mission.  Mars Express, leaving n 2003, will study the  atmosphere and surface for a full Martian year of 687 days  with seven instruments.   Topographic maps will be made,  rock and soil analysis will be taken in infra-red, and  measurements of Mars interior composition will be made with  radar.  The atmosphere will also be studied along with the  solar wind. From these studies we will measure the  atmospheric composition and structure.  In addition, the  United Kingdom is planning to fly a lander with the Mars  Express orbiter.  This will be known as the Beagle 2(the first  Beagle being Darwin's ship on which he discovered the theory  of evolution).  This lander will conduct a search for life on  Mars.

NASA had to scratch this date and the  plans are now for an Airplane mission in the year 2005.  The  Mars Airplane had an estimated cost of $100 million. The  plane would mark the first time a winged vehicle has flown on  another planetary body other than the Earth.  A proposed  mission agenda for the plane would have it fly through the  Vallis Marineris, a martian canyon 2,400 miles long and more  than five miles deep. This flight would give scientists an up- close look at the canyon's walls, which could give information  on millions of years of Mar's geological history.  Flying on  Mars won't be any easy task.  It's atmosphere is only one  percent as dense as Earth's.  The wings of the Mars Airplane  will be put the an extreme test to generate lift. The European Space Agency has planned the Mars Express  mission.  Mars Express, leaving n 2003, will study the  atmosphere and surface for a full Martian year of 687 days  with seven instruments.   Topographic maps will be made,  rock and soil analysis will be taken in infra-red, and  measurements of Mars interior composition will be made with  radar.  The atmosphere will also be studied along with the  solar wind. From these studies we will measure the  atmospheric composition and structure.  In addition, the  United Kingdom is planning to fly a lander with the Mars  Express orbiter.  This will be known as the Beagle 2(the first  Beagle being Darwin's ship on which he discovered the theory  of evolution).  This lander will conduct a search for life on  Mars.  It's landing mechanism will combine a  parachute/airbag to protect it on it's descent.  The Beagle 2  will carry a robotic arm, stereo color imager, a small drilling  unit, and a video camera.  The mission will try to answer if  Mars has water, organic matter, or carbonates.  The discovery  of these things could provide important clues on current, past,  or future life on Mars. The long-term future of missions to Mars is currently unclear.   Everything will depend on gaining small successes in the  currently planned missions.  Small steps could lead up to big  future planes for NASA.  Everything could lead up to future  colonization plans and everyday flights to and from the 4th  rock from the sun. The exploration of Mars will continue into our future.  Plans  have all ready been made for several Mars missions in the  near future. The 2001 opportunity to launch for Mars will see  the next two Mars Surveyor Program missions.  These are  known as the Mars Surveyor 2001 Orbiter and Lander.  On  the lander there will be a rover, the first since Mars Pathfinder's  Sojourner rover in 1997.  This 2001 mission will give scientists  some new looks on Mars and some new information for more  future missions.   The 2001 Lander will carry a descent  camera, which will use during its rocket-assisted landing.  Pictures sent back will provide information for landing future  probes, and help in the planning of future rover missions.  The  lander will also carry several interesting experiments for future  human missions.  One experiment will test the capability of  converting Martian atmosphere into rocket fuel, which will be  of vital importance for manned missions.  There will be  experiments testing if the Martian environment will be harmful  to human explorers.   A Gamma Ray Spectometer will map the  global elemental composition of Mars and search for  hydrogen and water below the surface of the red planet.

Previous Mars missions include launching the Pathfinder,  Viking, and Mariner.  The landings became smoother as more  experience was logged down in the books.  Scientists were  able to obtain statistics such as temperature, pressure, and  wind by way of a remote control rover, which took ten minutes  to get the signal to.  It sent back 2.6 billion bits of data  including chemical analyses of rocks and soil.  It also took  photos of "dust devils," the red sky with blue clouds, and the  Martian sunset.  These machines are still up there with no  batter power to do anything.  There are still no signs of life but  scientists were optimistical towards future missions.
